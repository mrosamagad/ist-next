            solar PV power system that is connected to the utility grid. A
            grid-connected PV system consists of solar panels, one or several
            inverters, a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment.
            They range from small residential and commercial rooftop systems to
            large utility-scale solar power stations. When conditions are right,
            the grid-connected PV system supplies the excess power, beyond
            consumption by the connected load, to the utility grid

          <h2>On-Grid System</h2>
          <p>
            On-Grid systems are solar systems that generate energy only when
            they are connected to the public electrical power network. They are
            stations that can be installed in all facilities, homes, schools,
            factories, hospitals...etc. The station is connected to the
            electricity network, the energy produced is used, and the surplus is
            sold. Energy generated from solar cells according to the price
            announced to electricity distribution companies under long-term
            contracts It is considered the simplest and most cost-effective
            system, as the capital recovery cycle for this station ranges from
            2-4 years, and the economic return increases when the entire
            generated energy is consumed. It does not have batteries, which have
            a relatively short lifespan, and this reduces the station’s costs
            and operating expenses compared to a station that is not connected
            to the off grid. In these systems, an emergency system can be
            created to work only during a power outage in the public network, or
            the entire station can be operated with a hybrid system called a
            hybrid system. This system contains a smaller number of batteries
            than the off-grid system .
