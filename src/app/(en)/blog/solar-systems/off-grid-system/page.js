            Grid-connected buildings receive electricity from power plants,
            which mainly use natural resources such as coal and natural gas as
            energy to convert into electrical power. 2017 is breakdown of world
            energy sources shows that the globe, mainly dependent on grid power,
            uses a majority of non-renewables, while popular renewables such as
            solar PV and wind power are a small portion. When off the grid, such
            as in Africa where 55% people of do not have access to electricity,
            buildings and homes must take advantage of the renewable energy
            sources around them, because it is the most abundant and allows for
            self-sufficiency..

            Solar energy system that is not connected to the electricity grid.
            These systems are designed for situations that are not connected to
            the electricity grid, and they provide you with energy by converting
            the energy generated from solar panels, which is converted into
            electricity and stored in batteries via an electrical inverter. In
            these systems, loads must be carefully calculated in order for them
            to work efficiently and reliably. These systems are suitable for
            areas and situations where it is impossible to access the government
            electricity network. These systems, designed by our engineers, can
            provide self-sufficiency for long periods during the year with
            varying weather conditions . .
