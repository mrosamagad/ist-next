            solar light , is a lighting system composed of an LED lamp, solar
            panels, battery, charge controller and there may also be an
            inverter. The lamp operates on electricity from batteries, charged
            through the use of solar panel "solar photovoltaic panel"
            Solar-powered household lighting can replace other light sources
            like candles or kerosene lamps. Solar lamps have a lower operating
            cost than kerosene lamps because renewable energy from the sun is
            free, unlike fuel. In addition, solar lamps produce no indoor air
            pollution unlike kerosene lamps. However, solar lamps generally have
            a higher initial cost, and are weather dependent.
