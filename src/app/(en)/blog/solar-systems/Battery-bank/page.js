            The battery bank is one of the most complicated and costly
            components of any off-grid power system. Your battery storage needs
            to be large enough to supply power year-round. Nothing is more
            frustrating than suffering a power outage because your battery bank
            doesn’t store enough charge. On the other hand, too much battery
            capacity means your system won’t be able to fully recharge. If your
            battery bank is too large, your batteries can’t get the full charge,
            which can ruin the batteries. Dialing in on the right battery bank
            is an important step to designing your off-grid system. You want to
            make sure you hit the sweet spot.

          <h2>What’s in a Battery Bank?</h2>
          <p>
          A battery bank can be composed of a single battery, or multiple interconnected batteries that are wired to work as one large battery at a certain voltage and amp-hour capacity.
          <br/><br/><b>IST</b> has Specialized Engineers who design  battery banks to pair with our off-grid systems. They include some extra components to ensure the system works out of the box
