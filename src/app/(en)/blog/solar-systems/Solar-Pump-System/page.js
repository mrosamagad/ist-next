            Water your fields with the power from the Sun: A solar water pump
            system is essentially an electrical pump system in which the
            electricity is provided by one or several Photo Voltaic "PV" panels.
            A typical solar powered pumping system consists of a solar panel
            array that powers an electric motor, which in turn powers a bore or
            surface pump. With the cost of diesel and electricity rising
            constantly, solar powered water pumps are the perfect alternative
            for rural regions as these have a low maintenance cost and ensure a
            long product life..

            There is no doubt that IST’s solutions for operating water wells
            with solar energy instead of diesel or government electricity are
            the ideal way to properly invest capital, as it is recovered in a
            period not exceeding two years with the best materials and equipment
            used, including solar panels and inverters designated for wells that
            operate with solar energy and solar panels. Control, protection, DC
            cables, and color holders can withstand long lifespan and
            fluctuating weather factors such as wind, humidity, etc. Using pumps
            and motors of the best types offered in the Egyptian market, thus we
            achieve the highest performance in the projects implemented through
            our company. IST is unique in providing many solutions for
            individuals and companies working in the field of solar energy for
            dual operation of the inverter between two different energy sources
            (solar energy - generator or Electricity) to obtain the best
            performance at the lowest possible cost by using protection and
            control panels that are designed and implemented by our engineers.
