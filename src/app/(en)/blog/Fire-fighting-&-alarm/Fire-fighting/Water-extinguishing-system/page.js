            Water-based systems are used for protecting fire scenarios where the
            main hazard is fire spread caused primarily by thermal radiation. A
            typical example are fires at tank farms and bulk storage facilities
            where, besides extinguishing the main spill fire, a quick and
            powerful cooling is required for protecting adjacent surfaces from
            radiated heat. Typical water-based fire-fighting systems are Deluge
            Systems, dry pipe and wet pipe fire Sprinkler Systems, or Preaction
            Systems, hybrids of deluge and sprinkler systems. Besides the above
            mentioned fixed systems, other water-based extinguishing systems are
            water branch pipes and hydraulic nozzles with adjustable spray
            pattern, both to be installed on monitors, or else hand operated
            water branch pipes, in different models and capacities, to connect
            to fire hydrants by means of flexible sleeves, for a more capillary
            action and close to minor spills.It is the cheapest type of fire
            system because it uses water to extinguish, but it is not suitable
            in all fire situations such as (electricity, oils, open spaces)

          <h2>Fire Sprinkler System</h2>
          <p>
            <b>A fire sprinkler system</b> is an active fire protection method,
            consisting of a water supply system providing adequate pressure and
            flowrate to a water distribution piping system, to which fire
            sprinklers are connected. Although initially used only in factories
            and large commercial buildings, systems for homes and small
            buildings are now available at a cost-effective price. Fire
            sprinkler systems are extensively used worldwide, with over 40
            million sprinkler heads fitted each year. Fire sprinkler systems are
            generally designed as a life saving system, but are not necessarily
            designed to protect the building. Of buildings completely protected
            by fire sprinkler systems, if a fire did initiate, it was controlled
            by the fire sprinklers alone in 96% of these cases
