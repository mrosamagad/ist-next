            The “foam” in foam fire suppression systems is an extinguishing
            agent that can extinguish flammable or combustible liquid by cooling
            and separating the ignition source from the surface. The foam
            suppresses and smothers fire and vapors alike. It can also prevent
            reignition. It is also known as “firefighting foam.” This foaming
            agent is made up of small air-filled bubbles that have a lower
            density than water. Foam is made up of water, foam concentrate, and
            air. Different manufacturers have their own foam solutions and
            concentrate. The proportion of foam to water depends on the
            application.

          <h2>How does foam suppression systems put out fires?</h2>
          <p>
            Foam suppression systems are used to “cool the fire and coat the
            fuel that the fire is consuming to prevent contact with oxygen and
            reduce combustion ability.” The foam, when dispursed, smothers or
            blankets the surface of the fuel. The water content of the foam then
            cools the fuel and the area of foam covering the fuel to prevent
            reignition via flammable vapors. Foam suppression systems are
            designed much like a wet sprinkler system in that stored water flows
            through a network of pipes where it is then discharged through
            nozzles. The main difference with foam systems and other traditional
            wet sprinkler systems is the addition of the foaming agent. This
            foaming agent is stored separately from the water and the two are
            mixed within the piping system prior to discharge. At the end of the
            piping is a nozzle. The foaming agent is added or ejected into the
            water at the very last moment before discharge. When the water mixes
            with the foaming agent, expansion occurs and creates an immense
            coverage of foam to fill expansive areas. Foam suppression systems
            are usually in large areas where there is a lot of flammable or
            combustible liquids such as Warehouses, Marine Applications,
            Flammable liquid storage, Jet engine testing facilities and aircraft
            hangars. The foam system is most commonly used in these areas is
            because of the capabilities of foam to not only extinguish but also
            smother flames in a way that prevents reignition. Special hazard
            fire suppression systems can provide highly effective and reliable
            protection when water-based systems are just not enough. Whether it
            be highly flammable materials, data centers, pharmaceutical,
            industrial, commercial, military, or protection of priceless
            commodities, a special hazard fire protection system may be the
            right solution to protect your assets. These systems require
            precision, specialized understanding, and careful engineering to
            meet industry standards and perform properly when needed most.
