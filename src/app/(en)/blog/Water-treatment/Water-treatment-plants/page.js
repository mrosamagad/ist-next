            Water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water to
            make it appropriate for a specific end-use. The end use may be
            drinking, industrial water supply, irrigation, river flow
            maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, including being
            safely returned to the environment. Water treatment removes
            contaminants and undesirable components, or reduces their
            concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use.
            This treatment is crucial to human health and allows humans to
            benefit from both drinking and irrigation use.

            <b>ECORD Consulting Company</b> designs and supervises the implementation
            of water treatment plants (wells - groundwater - seawater) with
            various production capacities. All accessories for the water
            treatment units are equipped with water networks (drainage and
            drinking). We design and supervise the implementation of drinking
            water plants for various production capacities, where raw water is
            filtered and sterilized using the latest modern methods, including
            the sedimentation and collection unit, the filtration unit, and the
            sterilization unit, as well as recycling within the system
