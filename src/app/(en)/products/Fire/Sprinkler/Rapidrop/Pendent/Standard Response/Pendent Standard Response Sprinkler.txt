Rapidrop RD022 fire sprinklers are pendent (SSP), standard response, frangible glass bulb automatic sprinklers that are CE, VdS, LPCB, FM approved and UL listed.

They are standard orifice fire sprinklers for installation in fire sprinkler systems designed in accordance with standard installation rules, e.g. EN12845 or the requirements of the authority having jurisdiction.

SSP Pendent sprinklers produce a hemispherical water distribution pattern below the deflector. In the instance of fire, the heat causes the fluid in the glass bulb to expand which shatters the glass and releases the spring seal assembly. Water flows from the orifice onto the sprinkler deflector which diffuses the water into a uniform spray pattern which extinguishes or controls the fire.
