The Cla-Val Model 50B-4KG1 Globe / 2050B-4KG1 Angle Pressure Relief Valve is designed specifically to automatically relieve excess pressure in fire protection pumping systems. Pilot controlled, it maintains constant system pressure at the pump discharge within very close limits as demands change. At pump start, Cla-Val Relief Valve modulates to relieve excess pump capacity, maintaining positive system pressure at the pump discharge. When fire demand slows or ceases, Cla-Val Model 50B-4KG1 opens, diverting entire pump output to discharge, allowing the fire pump to be stopped without causing surging in the lines.
