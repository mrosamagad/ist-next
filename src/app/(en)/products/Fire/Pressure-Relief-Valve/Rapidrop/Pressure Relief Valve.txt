Cla-Val Model 50B-4KG1 (Globe) / 2050B-4KG1 (Angle) Pressure Relief Valves are designed specifically to automatically relieve excess pressure in fire protection pumping systems.  Pilot controlled, it maintains constant system pressure at the pump discharge within very close limits as demands change.

Advantages include:
UL Listed, FM Approved
Fast Opening to Maintain Steady Line Pressure
Accommodates Wide Range of Flow Rates
Closes Gradually for Surge-Free Operation
Adjustable Pressure Settings, Not Affected by Pressure At Valve Discharge
How it works:
At pump start, Cla-Val Relief Valve modulates to relieve excess pump capacity, maintaining positive system pressure at the pump discharge.
 
When fire demand slows or ceases, Cla-Val Model  50B-4KG1 opens, diverting entire pump output to discharge, allowing the fire pump to be stopped without causing surging in the lines.
