A dry barrel fire hydrant is a type of fire hydrant commonly used in regions where freezing temperatures are a concern. Dry barrel hydrant is designed to automatically drain all water from its above ground components when not in use, preventing the water from freezing and causing damage to the hydrant. The hydrant’s construction is robust and durable, designed to withstand exposure to the elements and resist corrosion.
During a fire emergency, firefighters can access water from the main supply by opening the main valve, allowing the water to flow into the hydrant. The hydrant’s design allows multiple hoses to be connected simultaneously, providing a substantial flow of water to extinguish fires effectively.
