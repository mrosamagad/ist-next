The model RDVSR-AT (EU) is an electronic vane type waterflow switch for use on wet sprinkler systems. It is UL Listed for use on steel pipe schedules 5 through 40 sizes 50mm to 150mm (2”-6”), UL Listed and FM Approved for use on steel pipe; schedule 10 through 40, sizes 50mm thru 200mm (2”-8”) and BS1387 light through heavy. See ordering Information chart.

The RDVSR-AT (EU) may also be used as a sectional waterflow detector on large systems. The RDVSR-AT (EU) has two sets of alarm contacts and an adjustable instantly recycling electronic retard. The alarm contacts are actuated when a flow of 38 LPM (10 GPM) or more occurs downstream of the device. The flow condition must exist for a period of time necessary to overcome the selected retard time. The RDVSR-AT (EU) may be remotely tested without flowing water by using the optional Auto Test Control model ATC- 1or ATC-4 or the use of addressable relays and monitor modules as part of a listed addressable fire alarm panel.

When the auto test feature is initiated, the RDVSR-AT (EU) performs a self test to ensure compliance with UL requirements regarding waterflow detection and retard time. In addition, the auto test feature ensures the integrity of the paddle/trip stem assembly. A successful completion of the auto test will activate both sets of normally open contacts on the flow switch. If the auto test detects a problem with the trip stem/paddle assembly or if there is no water in the pipe, neither normally open contact will operate and the flow switch will indicate a trouble condition at the test switch and transmit a trouble signal to the fire alarm panel.
